	<li><h4>Sun</h4><div style="display:flex"><img src="download.jfif" align="left"><span><p><b>The Sun</b> is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball 
of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. <b>The Sun</b> radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most 
important source of energy for life on Earth.The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth.Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, 
comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. </p></span><span></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Mercury</h4><div style="display:flex"><img src="download (2).jfif" align="left"><span><p> The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,<b> Mercury</b> 
is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of <b>Mercury</b>, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would 
be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, <b>Mercury</b> is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense 
atmosphere.</p></span><span></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Venus</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (3).jfif"></span><span><img src="download (4).jfif"></span><span><p> <b>Venus</b> is the second planet from the 
Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. 
These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds. <b>Venus</b> has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually 
shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to 
the Sun. Surface temperatures on <b>Venus</b> are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely 
crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.</p></span><span></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Earth</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (1).jfif" align="left"></span><span><p> Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only 
place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While <b><u>Earth</u></b> is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid 
water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, <b>Earth</b> is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. The name Earth is at 
least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for <b>Earth</b>, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”

	<li><h4>Mars</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (5).jfif" align="left"></span><span><p> ​<b>Mars</b> is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world 
with a very thin atmosphere. <b>Mars</b> is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. <b>Mars</b> is one 
of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), 
one lander (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars. Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on
 <b>Mars</b> on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers). The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance. Mars

	<li><h4>Jupiter</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (6).jfif" align="left"></span><p> <b>Jupiter</b> has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 
1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, <b>Jupiter</b> is, by far, the largest planet in the 
solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an 
atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Saturn</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (7).jfif" align="left"></span><p> <b>Saturn</b> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in 
our solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, <b>Saturn</b> is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none 
are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, <b>Saturn</b> is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.</p></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Uranus</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (8).jfif" align="left"></span><p> <b>Uranus</b> is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest 
diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, <b>Uranus</b> was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it 
was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel 
tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it <b>Uranus</b>, the Greek god of the sky, 
as suggested by Bode.​</p></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Neptune</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (9).jfif" align="left"></span><p> Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant <b>Neptune</b> is the 
eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, <b>Neptune</b> is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the 
first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 <b>Neptune</b> completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have 
visited <b>Neptune</b> up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.</p></span></div></li>
	<li><h4>Pluto</h4><div style="display:flex"><span><img src="download (10).jfif" align="left"></span><p> <b><i>Pluto</i></b> is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped region of 
icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. There may be millions of these icy objects, collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), in this
 distant region of our solar system.<b><i>Pluto</i></b> – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma. This fascinating world has blue 
skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows – but the snow is red. On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the 
<b><i>Pluto</i></b> system – providing the first close-up images of Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding of these mysterious worlds on the solar 
system’s outer frontier. </p></span></div></li>
